Resizing existing volumes
Viewing information about disks and volumes
Features:

Easy-to-use menu-driven interface

#Requirements:

Python 3.x (Note: The script might require additional modules like disk_management and volume_management which are not included here. You might need to install them separately.)
How to Use:

Save the script as diskman.py.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
Run the script using the following command:
python diskman.py

#Disclaimer:

Formatting a disk or partition will erase all data on it. Ensure proper backups before proceeding.
Use the tool with caution, as incorrect usage can lead to data loss.
#Example Usage:

Select a specific disk.
Create a new partition with a size of 2048 MB.
Format the selected disk's volume with the NTFS file system and a volume label of "DATA".

Further Development:

Implement delete partition functionality.
Enhance error handling for user input and potential disk operations failures.
Consider adding support for additional file systems and advanced formatting options.
